## How WakaTime defines activity

A WakaTime account that’s in use within the last 2 years is considered active.
Activity includes these actions:

* Browsing the WakaTime website (while logged into your WakaTime account)
* Generating code stats
* Using Sign in with WakaTime to sign in to a third-party app or service

## What if the username I want is already taken?

Keep in mind that not all activity on WakaTime is publicly visible.
Accounts with no visible activity may be in active use.

If the username you want is already claimed, consider other names or variations.
If you suspect the account is inactive, [email us][email username] to request the username.

## Trademark Policy

A WakaTime account with a username that happens to be the same as a registered trademark is not necessarily a violation of our trademark policy.
Using a business name, logo, or other trademark in a manner that may mislead or confuse others with regard to it’s brand or business affiliation may be considered a trademark policy violation.
If you have a registered trademark and believe someone’s account is violating your trademark rights, [email us][email trademark] with your registered trademark information and the username of the account you’re reporting.

## Name Squatting Policy

WakaTime prohibits account name squatting, and account names may not be reserved or inactively held for future use.
Accounts violating this name squatting policy may be removed or renamed without notice.
Attempts to sell, buy, or solicit other forms of payment in exchange for account names are prohibited and may result in permanent account suspension.
