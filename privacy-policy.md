## Information we collect

We collect information in the following ways:

* **Account and profile information.** When you sign up for a WakaTime account,
  we store information such as your email address. This will never be shared
  publicly without your consent.
* **Billing information.** We collect billing address and credit card
  information if you purchase a premium version of WakaTime. Billing address
  and credit card information is securely passed to our payment processing
  partner and is not stored at WakaTime.
* **Plugin usage content.** We collect and store the path of the file you are
  editing, timestamps, project names, branch names, editor names &amp;
  versions, languages, libraries/imports from opened files, line counts of
  opened files, position of your cursor in opened files, your computer’s
  hostname, your computer’s timezone, your computer's operating system name and
  version information, and websites visited in your browser from your usage of
  our [downloadable plugins][editors]. We do not receive or store your source
  code. All plugin usage information will never be shared publicly without your
  consent. This information is deleted when you delete your WakaTime account.
* **Integrations.** If you grant us authorization to
  [integrate with another service provider][integrations], we will connect that
  service to ours and only collect data from that service which is necessary
  to provide you the integration service. For example when you connect the
  Google Calendar integration, we temporarily store the names of your calendars
  during the integration setup process. After you have selected which calendars
  to integrate with WakaTime, we only store the calendar names, event titles,
  event start times, and event end times for the calendars you have selected.
  We do not receive or store calendar data for calendars which you have not
  selected. We do not receive or store your passwords or source code for any
  integration services. You can remove an integration at any time which unbinds
  that integration on a go-forward basis and deletes all content that was
  received from that service. Your content, including Google Calendar data, is
  also immediately deleted and no longer stored or indexed by WakaTime when you
  delete your WakaTime account.
* **Usage information.** We may collect information about the services you use
  and how you use them, like which pages you visit and which features you use.
  We use cookies with unique identifiers to authenticate your login session.
  Third parties, including but not limited to Google Analytics, may also use
  cookies to track your return visits to the website.

## How we use information we collect

We use the information we collect to provide, maintain, and protect services
for our users. We may also use this information to improve your
user-experience with our services.
We will ask for your consent before using any of your information for a
purpose other than set out in this Privacy Policy.

When you contact WakaTime, we may keep a record of your name and email address
to better solve any customer issues.
We may use your name and email address to inform you about our services, such
as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements.

## Information we share

We do not sell our users’ private personal information. We share information
about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate
safeguards on your privacy:

* **With your consent:** We may share and disclose information with your
  consent or at your direction. For example, we may share your information with
  third parties with which you authorize us to do so, such as the integrations
  that you connect to your account through our Integrations feature.
* **Aggregated and de-identified information:** We may share information that
  has been aggregated or reasonably de-identified, so that the information
  could not reasonably be used to identify you. For example, we may publish
  aggregate statistics about the use of our Services.
* **As required by law:** We may disclose information about you in response to
  a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.

## Information security

We work hard to protect your private information. We enforce SSL when our users
communicate with WakaTime. We use a [one-way hash algorithm][bcrypt] with
random salt to store your password.

We use a third party, [Stripe][stripe], to store your credit card information
and process payments. Your credit card information is never stored or
transmitted using our servers. We only store the last 4 digits, expiration
date, and card type of your credit card on our servers for reference. Your
credit card information is governed by
[Stripe's Privacy Policy][stripe privacy].

## Changes

We reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to make changes to
this Policy from time to time. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically
to check for updates. If the changes are significant, we may notify you or
provide an additional opportunity to "opt-in", as appropriate.
